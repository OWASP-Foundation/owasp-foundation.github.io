At the end of every month, I review the Temporary COVID Restrictions and look around the world to see what's happening. I think we're all looking forward to getting back to normal now that there's a vaccine and it seems to be doing a tremendous job of reducing deaths and hospitalizations. In the meantime, we still need to be staying safe. To that end, I've simplified the restrictions *a lot*, and also made it clear when we can start to return to physical events.

Some countries have dealt with COVID in a very strong way, and their economy is more or less completely back to normal. Other countries, such as where I live now in the USA, not so much. The variance between these two extremes means that a single policy definitely doesn't fit all, so nearly all restrictions have caveats and a way to obtain pre-approval if you have evidence that things are getting better in your region or country. Don't be afraid of asking for an exemption or pre-approval. The worst that can happen is that we will say "Plan for later this year, and let's see then..." 

Please review the updated temporary restrictions, and provide feedback or improvements per the instructions down the bottom.
