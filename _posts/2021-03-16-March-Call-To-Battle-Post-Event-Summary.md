## Veracode Secure Coding Challenge Summary 
The Call To Battle Secure Coding challenge brought together developers and security engineers two weeks ago to show 
off their secure coding skills.  Using Veracode's Security Labs Enterprise, all of the contestants worked on patching 
real OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in containerized environments, using the languages of their choice. The more 
languages a competitor knows, the more points they can score.  Out of the 18 fierce competitors, we had 9 who finished 
at the top of the leaderboard with 440 points, but it's also not just about completing the labs and getting the points, 
it's also about how fast you can solve each one.
