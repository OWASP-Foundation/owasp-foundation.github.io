title: 2021 AppSec Pacific Northwest Launches
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

OWASP Vancouver, Victoria, and Portland hosted the first AppSec Pacific Northwest on Saturday. This sold out virtual event featured keynotes from Kymberlee Price and Jim Manico. Content included builder, breaker, and defender talks and labs by established and emerging chapter members and a few of our global community of project leaders. Videos will be posted soon for those who missed the conference on the AppSecPNW YouTube channel. Next year will hopefully be in person so be sure to follow @pnwseccon on twitter or visit the conference website at pnwcon.com.  

The Pacific Northwest chapters want to create an event to highlight our local membership's talent, build community between our chapters, and engage the wider OWASP community to come explore our beautiful region. This year we had to do it virtually because of covid but we consider it to be a huge success. The organizers got to know each other quite well in the planning and execution of the event, our volunteers were rockstars the day of the conference making everything happen, true talent was displayed through our lineup of speakers, and there clearly was interest even in spite of zoom fatigue with over 1000 registrants.  <!--more-->

None of this would have happened without the support of the OWASP Foundation leadership and the help from our sponsors. Thank you!
