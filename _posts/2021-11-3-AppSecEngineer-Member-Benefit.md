title: OWASP Partners With we45 for AppSecEngineer Training Member Benefit
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

The OWASP Foundation is very pleased to announce that we45 has become our latest partner, providing a DevSecOps training membership benefit to OWASP members through AppSecEngineer.

I thank we45 for their generous support of OWASP, providing free DevSecOps and Security Automation Training to OWASP members through their Training Suite, AppSecEngineer. Today, DevSecOps is the predominant method of developing and operating secure systems, and it’s time for our industry to move away from 'stage gates' and being a blocker, to understanding how high-performance development teams build software. AppSecEngineer’s online training will help all OWASP members drastically improve their skills and knowledge in secure software development.

> It's a really exciting time for us, both as security trainers and service providers. The more fluent teams become with product security and DevSecOps, the easier it becomes for them to organically integrate secure practices into the DNA of their software at every stage of development. This partnership is a big part of that vision, and being able to assist such a storied institution of AppSec as OWASP is an honour for all of us at we45.
