The OWASP Foundation is excited to announce the launch of Virtual AppSec Days. Taking place later this month, 
we have an entire week of virtual activities planned, to engage, educate, and entertain our community.  

The event will begin on April 27 with a virtual mini-conference; a free 90-minute session consisting of 
three 20-minute lightning talks by AppSec industry leaders. <!--more--> 

The following two days, April 28-29, we will be offering a variety of [virtual training courses](https://appsecdays.org/trainings/) 
at a deeply discounted price.

To finish-up the week, test your skills in our [48hr virtual Capture the Flag](https://appsecdays.org/ctf/) on April 30. 

For full details and to register, visit [appsecdays.org](https://appsecdays.org]

Hope to see you there!
