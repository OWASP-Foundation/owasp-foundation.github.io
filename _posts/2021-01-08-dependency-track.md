Over the last few years, the [OWASP Dependency-Track project](https://owasp.org/dependencytrack) has led an industry shift towards framing open source risk as a subset of software supply chain risk. Dependency-Track was one of the first platforms to fully embrace Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) as a core tenant and design principal. The project is attributable to the creation of [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), an open source SBOM standard used by thousands of organizations, referenced by multiple RFCs and related supply chain initiatives.

Dependency-Track v3 has proven that SBOMs can be created, consumed, and analyzed at high-velocity in modern build pipelines. And its proven the value of full-stack transparency for IoT and embedded devices. Based on feedback from the community, from industry, and from government-led software transparency efforts, the project has made strategic enhancements to the software that sets the stage for future capabilities that are only achievable from the use of SBOMs. <!--more-->

A new year is an opportunity to rethink how to approach third-party, open source, and software supply chain risk. It's an opportunity to try out the latest release, Dependency-Track v4.

With the release of Dependency-Track v4, the project has introduced:

* Configurable policies and auditing workflow
* Support for CycloneDX v1.2 and SPDX 2.2 SBOM formats
* Support for SWID Tag IDs
* Firmware and container component types
* Many architectural and other enhancements

The remainder of the 4.x versions will focus on increasing the types of risk that can be identified, SBOM-specific capabilities, and increasing the number of solutions the platform integrates with.
