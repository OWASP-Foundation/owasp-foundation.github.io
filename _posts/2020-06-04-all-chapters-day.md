Join 24 chapters around the globe for a 24 hour long back-to-back virtual chapter meetup.  The entire event will be livestreamed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNkJT42qFOBdnD8pCpelrw/videos?view=2&flow=grid&live_view=502) from 16 countries. The schedule of those talks is available [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/pages/social/chapters_all_day/schedule/).

The OWASP Leaders List is a mailing list populated by either Chapter or Project Leaders or folks who previously held those positions.  The mailing list is a busy place and ideas flow there regularly - because the folks on that list are good folks with great ideas. 

Sometimes an idea hits the list that requires real work to happen and this initiative was one of those fortunately there were plenty of volunteers to step up and make it happen.
