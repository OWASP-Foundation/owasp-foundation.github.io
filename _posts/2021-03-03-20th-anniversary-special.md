September 24, 2021 marks OWASP's 20th Anniversary! We are kicking off our 20th Anniversary celebrations with a 20% off two-year membership sale, starting right now and running for the next 20 days. 20% off a two-year membership or renewal is a great way to support us and get involved in our community! We have a lot more planned throughout the year!

Join or renew today: [https://owasp.org/membership/](https://owasp.org/membership/)

Some of the many membership benefits include supporting our [projects](https://owasp.org/projects/) and [chapters](https://owasp.org/chapters/), access to [SecureFlag](https://secureflag.owasp.org/) and other Learning Platform benefits, free access to the many "Pro" level services from the OWASP Foundation, and of course, member discounts to our events, and much more.

From humble beginnings as a small informal team of our industry's best talent seeking to change the world, including Mark Curphey, Dennis Groves, and many others, OWASP has grown to be the only global, diverse, and most influential application security non-profit in the world. We've made a tremendous impact, and still, we need to make an even more significant impact in the future. We would not be able to do this without our members, leaders, sponsors, and of course, our community.

[OWASP's 20th Anniversary Celebration](https://20thanniversary.owasp.org/) consists of many activities and events throughout the year, which will culminate in OWASP's first-ever 24-hour free event on our anniversary on September 24, 2021. We have opened the [Call for Papers](https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/189297/owasps-20th-anniversary-call-for-speakers), [Paper Review Team](https://owasp.submittable.com/submit/188746/call-for-program-review-team-for-2021-owasps-20th-anniversary-2021-owasp-vir), and [Sponsors](https://20thanniversary.owasp.org/sponsors/) today. More details will be shared with everyone this coming Monday. It's going to be a huge event that I hope you can be involved in, either speaking, sponsoring, or attending! Our 20th Anniversary Event will be free to participate in, but we would love [donations](https://owasp.org/donate/) or [sponsorships](https://20thanniversary.owasp.org/sponsors/) to help run the event!
