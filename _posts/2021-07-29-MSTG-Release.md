title: OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide Release
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

---

Earlier this week we (Carlos Holguera and myself) created a new release of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide!](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)

For this release we adapted the document build pipeline from the OWASP Mobile AppSec Verification Standard (MASVS) and can now automatically create a release for the MSTG as PDF, docx and ePub which allows us to release more frequently. If you are interested in the magic behind it, you can find the Github Action of the release [here](https://lnkd.in/gw6bntG)

We want to thank:
- Jeroen Beckers for all the continuous support and his valuable input for the OWASP MSTG project in general,
- Jeroen Willemsen for all the support in the last year to get us on the right track for the build pipeline and
<!--more-->
- all contributors, whoever supported financially or volunteered their time for the project that helped us to improve the quality of the document, from fixing typos or writing completely new test cases in the last 1.5 years for this new release! The high quality of the MSTG wouldnâ€™t be possible without this fantastic community!
