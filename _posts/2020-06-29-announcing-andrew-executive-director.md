It is with great pleasure that the OWASP Foundation announces that as per today, Monday 29th June 2020 we will have a new, full time, Executive Director (ED), selected from within our own ranks.  As per this date Andrew van der Stock will officially take on the role of the ED for the Foundation on a permanent basis.

Andrew is well known to many in the OWASP Community for both his hard work on a number of key OWASP Projects (including the OWASP Top Ten and the OWASP ASVS) as well as for his time on the Global Board of Directors, representing the OWASP Community from 2015 to 2018. He brings years of AppSec experience to the role as well as his breadth of experience managing organisational units. We are sure he will bring this to his new role in the Foundation and will be a great ED. <!--more-->

We want to extend our deepest thanks to Mike McCamon who has served as the Executive Director on a part-time basis in an absolutely stellar manner and who has helped navigate the Foundation through some complicated waters throughout the years.

Mike will remain with the Foundation in an advisory role for a period of time to ensure that the transition happens smoothly while Andrew and the rest of the Foundation staff are brought up to speed and able to carry things forward and we want to thank him for his contributions in furthering the mission of the Foundation, and wish him the best on his future endeavours.


Owen Pendlebury
Chairman, on behalf of the Global Board of Directors
