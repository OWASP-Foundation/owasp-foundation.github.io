The OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit organization providing open-source projects, tools, documentation, etc., to help security professionals succeed by improving to keep their company's data secure! Our open-source materials are supported by the financial contributions of our Corporate Members, and they are fundamentally important to help us continue to fulfill our mission by providing these resources. As a corporate member, supporting the OWASP Foundation demonstrates the companies commitment to the community, the Foundation, and the entire AppSec sector.

OWASP strives to provide opportunities to companies with all budget types so everyone can participate.  That being said, we are happy to announce that we now offer **discounted corporate membership** for companies in developing regions and discounted rates for start-up companies!  Qualify, and be one of the first ten companies to [join the Foundation as a corporate member](https://owasp.org/supporters/) to receive a special incentive.
