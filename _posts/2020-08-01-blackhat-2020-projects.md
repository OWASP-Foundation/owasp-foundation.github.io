<p class="callout-mono left">OWASP Top 10</p>

The
[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is a standard
awareness document for developers and web application security. It
represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to
web applications. Companies should adopt this document and start the
process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks.
Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards
changing the software development culture within your organization into
one that produces more secure code.

Andrew van der Stock is one of the project leaders of the OWASP Top 10
and
[Application Security Verification Standard](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
projects. He is also the Executive Director of the OWASP Foundation and
previously served on the OWASP Foundation Board as director and
treasurer.<br><br><br><br><br>

[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop) is probably the most modern
and sophisticated insecure web application for security trainings,
awareness demos and CTFs. Also great voluntary guinea pig for your
security tools and DevSecOps pipelines! Juice Shop joined the OWASP
project family in 2016 and was promoted to
[Flagship Project](https://owasp.org/projects/#div-flagships) (<i
class="fas fa-flag" style="color:#2ADA08;"></i>) level not even two
years later. With the next major release (`v12.0.0`) will have 100+
built-in hacking challenges wrapped in its realistic eCommerce costume!

Bjoern Kimminich is the inventor and project leader of OWASP Juice Shop
and serves also as a board member for the German OWASP chapter. He gave
talks at dozens of local and global OWASP events and never tires to
provide project collaborators and conference visitors with Juice Shop
stickers and other merchandise.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
