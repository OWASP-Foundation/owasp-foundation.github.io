It’s hard to believe it’s already December! Along with the holiday spirit, December brings increased outreach from charities. For many nonprofits, this is when these organizations receive the bulk of their funding. Individuals are at their most generous and look for ways to help others while also ensuring they get all of their tax deductions*.

In truth, if everyone reading this message right now made a donation to the OWASP Foundation, we’d have the resources needed to greatly expand and improve our projects, chapters, materials, tools, documentation, etc. in 2021.

If the time is right, please take a moment to make a tax-deductible* gift to the OWASP Foundation today. Click the button below to give securely and with ease via credit card.

*As a public charity (IRS PC category), donations to OWASP are likely to be tax deductible to many US based individuals and organizations. Please review the IRS guidance to determine if you are eligible to claim a tax deduction on your next return: https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-contributions
