The new OWASP Membership Portal soft launched on July 1st. The membership portal displays information about your OWASP membership and also allows you to edit your personal 
details. In addition, the portal provides links to content that is of interest to members including certain membership benefits. You can access the portal
using your OWASP Foundation email address by clicking on [Membership Portal.](https://members.owasp.org/) <!--more-->



### Who Can Access the Portal?
Anyone with a valid @owasp.org email address can access the portal but it will have limited funcitonality based on your membership status. If you are a current
OWASP Member and your membership data is linked with your @owasp.org email address, your membership details and personal information will be displayed. If you are
a current member but your @owasp.org email address is not linked to your membership, you will need to [Contact Us](https://contact.owasp.org/) to get your data
linked. For anyone with an @owasp.org email address who is not a member, you will be given the option to renew your membership from this page.



### What Information is Shown?
The screenshot below shows up the information displayed for members:

The **Membership Information** section shows your membership number, a QR Code (which can be scanned by staff at select events to verify your membership and allow entry
into our member-only areas), your membership type, and membership end date.

The **Personal Information** section shows your email addresses, physical addresses, and phone numbers we have on file. You may add and update this information as
needed.

To the right is a list of Useful Membership Links and in the upper right corner allows you to Logout when you are done.
