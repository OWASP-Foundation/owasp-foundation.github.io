### Packages available to all

Our new Corporate Membership packages are available to anyone, with price points for everyone. 

### Corporate Member Logo

Corporate members can use our new Corporate Membership logos on your website and marketing to demonstrate their support for OWASP. 

### OWASP Trademark License

For Corporate Members who offer products or services which use OWASP's trademarks, OWASP now has an OWASP trademark licensing program. You can directly obtain an OWASP trademark license through Corporate Membership (usually USD 1500 per service). Platinum Corporate Members are permitted to use our trademarks for an unlimited number of services or products. Gold can use it for up to 5 services or products. Silver can use the license for a single product or service.

Events (other than instructor-led training classes) are not included in this trademark license. If you are interested in running an OWASP themed conference, don't hesitate to contact our [Events team](mailto:events@owasp.com) for more details.

### Corporate Sponsorship of participating projects or chapters

Corporate Members can contribute 10% of their Corporate Membership fee to participating chapters or projects. OWASP will directly add this contribution to the Expenses pool with no administrative fee to benefit all Chapters and Projects. In return, participating Chapters or Projects should add your logo to their home page and are encouraged to recognize your contribution at the start of meetings or in the project's deliverable, where possible.

- Platinum 10 projects or chapters
- Gold 5 projects or chapters
- Silver 1 project or chapter

NB: Not all chapters or projects participate in this benefit. Please get in touch with us to connect you with the relevant Chapter or Project Leader.

### Corporate Sponsorship of participating AppSec Days events

Corporate Members can obtain early access to sponsor participating AppSec Day regional events. AppSec Days sponsorship fees vary from event to event, so please contact us for details. 

NB: Not all AppSec Day regional events participate in this benefit. Please get in touch with us to connect you with the relevant Event Leadership team.

### Early bird Global AppSec registrations

Many employers provide training and conferences as an employment benefit. Your staff can use the included Early Bird Global AppSec Registration discount codes. The discount code grants them access to the OWASP Member discount, even if they are not individual OWASP members. This benefit does not stack if they are individual members.  

| Package  | Global AppSec H1  | Global AppSec H2  |
| -------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Platinum | 10 discount codes | 10 discount codes |
| Gold     | 5 discount codes  | 5 discount codes  |
| Silver | 1 discount code   | 1 discount code   |

OWASP will send through your discount code entitlements for each event as registrations are first opened to ensure your staff doesn't miss out. The discount codes are only valid for the relevant Global AppSec within the early bird registration period and are not transferrable to another event.

* Global AppSec H1 is usually held in Europe in the first half of the year
* Global AppSec H2 is usually held in North America in the second half of the year

### Your logo on OWASP.org

Corporate Members can get their logo and a descriptive blurb on the OWASP.org website, which appear on our [supporters page](/supporters/list) and randomly at the bottom of every page on owasp.org. 

- Platinum Large size
- Gold Medium size
- Silver Standard size

We will work with you to obtain a transparent icon of 300px X 90px at 72dpi. Our website automatically sizes your icon per the Corporate Membership level.

### Rotation Priority

Our new Corporate Membership program implements improved rotation for Platinum and Gold members while still providing a great deal of exposure for Silver members. Platinum members will receive a 20% boost over a silver member, Gold 10% more likely to be shown than Silver, and our Silver members will share the residual rotation. OWASP.org website traffic has grown dramatically since 2019, with more than 4 million monthly page views. Hence, our Silver members still receive more views than in 2019, despite the lower ratio.

### Social Media Recognition

We will share your Corporate Membership regularly with our 300k+ followers:

- Platinum 4/month
- Gold 2/month
- Silver 1/month

We ask that Corporate Members do not market directly to our members but work with us to establish a partnership or member benefit instead.

### Early access to Global AppSec Sponsorship

Global AppSec Corporate Event Sponsorship packages are usually entirely sold out very quickly. You might miss out on your preferred location or desired [Corporate Sponsorship package](/corporate-sponsorships). This Platinum Corporate Membership benefit gives early access to the best packages, prime locations, and the best-sized booths. 

### News article upon signing

We will work with our Platinum and Gold Corporate Members to publish a short news article for the OWASP.org news content about your organization becoming an OWASP Corporate Member. We encourage you to turn the copy into a press release or put it in your marketing.

### Global AppSec Corporate Event Sponsorship Subsidy

Up to USD 2,500 of your Corporate Membership fee can be applied towards a Global AppSec sponsorship package.

| Package | Standard | Regional | Startup | Regional Startup |
| -- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Platinum | 2,500 | 1,000 | 1,000 | 400 |
| Gold | 2,500 | 600 | 600 | 240 |
| Silver | 2,500 | 200 | 200 | 80 |

We will honor all existing signed contracts for this benefit. After September 24 2021, the Standard discount will change to 10% of the overall package price.

### Ambassador for OWASP Board of Directors election vote

Corporate Members can nominate an Individual Corporate Ambassador to exercise a vote in the Global Board of Directors election.
