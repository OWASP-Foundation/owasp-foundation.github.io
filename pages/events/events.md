Ever wanted to network and learn along with other AppSec professionals? We host nearly a dozen events each year varying in format to week long trainings and conferences, to single day programs. OWASP events are a great way to:

- Improve your career skills
- Build your professional network
- Learn about new trends in the industry

While some of our events have corporate sponsors, the content is vendor neutral, and speakers are carefully selected ensuring a good return on your investment of time and money. Often times are larger events also host Expositions, Capture the Flags, and Career Fairs. Often members get a discount on conference passes.
