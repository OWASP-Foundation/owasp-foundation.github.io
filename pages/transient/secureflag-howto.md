### Secure Flag Membership Benefit 

OWASP Foundation has partnered with SecureFlag to provide our members with an application security training platform created for developers to learn and practice modern secure coding techniques through hands-on exercises.  Our instance can be located at [OWASP SecureFlag](https://secureflag.owasp.org/).  This is provided as a trial only for now and is being operated only in the EMEA and US regions; logging in from other regions may result in a degraded experience at this time.  We will investigate adding further regions in the future as the need arises.
