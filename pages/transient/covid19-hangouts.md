## Overview
Considering the ongoing international emergency regarding the COVID-19 Coronavirus, many of you have requested a method with which to conduct your meetings virtually.  Although the organization has Zoom capability, the number of OWASP accounts with the capability to host a large or lengthy meeting is insufficient for this purpose.  For that reason, we are recommending that you use Google Meet as your solution for meetings.  With the recent access granted by Google, you should be able to record meetings and invite up to 250 people.  Furthermore, the capability to stream the meeting has been enabled though it may take up to 24 hours for that to reach all accounts.  These services are for official OWASP meetings (chapter, project, and committee).
