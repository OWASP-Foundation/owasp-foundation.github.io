Global AppSec US Virtual 2021 returns Nov. 11-12, 2021. Designed for private and public sector infosec professionals, the two day OWASP conferences equip developers, defenders, and advocates to build a more secure web.

Join us for leading application security technologies, speakers, prospects, and community, in a unique event that will build on everything you already know to expect from an OWASP Global Conference.     

Sponsorship opportunities for this conference can be found [here](https://usa.globalappsec.org/assets/images/Global_AppSec_US_2021_Sponsorship_.pdf)
